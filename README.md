Boot sector [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) IDE and interpreter, fits in 512 bytes.

**This project is optimized for the resulting binary size, not performance.**

You can download prebuilt binaries [here](https://github.com/mat-sz/bfloader/releases).

## Running in QEMU

```
make && qemu-system-x86_64 bfloader.bin
```

## Usage

After running, type in your Brainfuck program using your keyboard (use arrow keys and Home/End keys to move the cursor) and press <kbd>F5</kbd> to execute it (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> to start step by step execution).
The output will be shown in between the separator and the blue line.

To stop the execution or to reset after completed execution hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. While debugging press <kbd>F5</kbd> to continue the program from the current step until the end.

To reset the state (remove the code from memory) and start from scratch, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>.
